{#
RAG Prompt: Evaluation
Purpose: Evaluate if RAG result needs web search supplementation
#}
Evaluate if the RAG result can answer the user's query.

ONLY respond with "NEEDS_WEBSEARCH: <query>" if ALL of these conditions are met:
1. The RAG result contains NO relevant information at all, OR
2. The query explicitly asks about current events, real-time data, or information after 2024, OR
3. The user explicitly requests external/web information

Otherwise, respond with: SUFFICIENT

Default to SUFFICIENT if the RAG result has ANY relevant content. Do NOT request web search just because the answer could be more complete.
